Explanation:
In this task, I created and visualized a Decision Tree using the Scikit-learn library in Python. I used a dataset of my choice to train the model so it can predict or classify outcomes based on the input features. This helped me understand how a machine can learn from data and make decisions step by step. Visualizing the tree also made it easier to see how the model splits data and makes predictions.
