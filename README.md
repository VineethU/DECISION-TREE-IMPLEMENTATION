Explanation:
In this task, I created and visualized a Decision Tree using the Scikit-learn library in Python. I used a dataset of my choice to train the model so it can predict or classify outcomes based on the input features. This helped me understand how a machine can learn from data and make decisions step by step. Visualizing the tree also made it easier to see how the model splits data and makes predictions.


In this task, I built a Decision Tree using Python.
I started by importing all the required libraries like pandas, sklearn, and matplotlib.
Then I loaded the Iris dataset, which has details about different flowers.
The dataset includes features like petal length, sepal width, etc.
I separated the data into features (X) and target (y).
Then I split the data into training and testing parts.
The training data helps the model learn, and testing checks how well it works.
I used the DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn to build the model.
After training the model, I used it to make predictions on the test data.
I checked how accurate the model was using accuracy score.
I also created a confusion matrix to see where the model made mistakes.
Next, I visualized the decision tree using a plotting function.
This helped me see how the model makes decisions step by step.
I also looked at which features were most important in predictions.
Overall, this task helped me understand how machines can learn and make decisions from data.
